    "**Description:** \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows the statistical results of extrapolating the regulating ecosystem service values of trees in the Oslo municipality using a Random Forest regression model. The model is trained on the i-Tree Eco trees within Oslo's urban tree database (registerte_traer_BYM_2018) and thereafter used to predict the regulating ecosystem service values for all trees within Oslo's building zone extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following regulating ecosystem services are predicted: \n",
    "\n",
    "- carbon storage (kg)\n",
    "- carbon sequestration (kg/year)\n",
    "- avoided runoff (m3/year)\n",
    "- avoided air pollution (g/year)\n",
    "- total regulating ecosystem benefits (NKr/year)\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictor variables used in the model are:\n",
    "- tree species (Norwegian name)\n",
    "- tree height (m)\n",
    "- crown area (m2)\n",
    "- pollution zone (zone 1, 2 or 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are visualized in a map product, which can be viewed online: [Bytr√¶ratlas Oslo](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/5191adc2c4b34658aea227c9853c6ebb)"
